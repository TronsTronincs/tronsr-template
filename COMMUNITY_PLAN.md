Describe the plan to support the community
Scholorships - We will be making several scholorships to the local community in the name of TRON. This will be served by essays being presented to us by the apllicants.  This will switch over to our future youth program after we have established our full program.
 
 Recruitment/Tallent - Our mission is to make TRON the most powerful Crytpcurrency in the world. At the same time we will be evdeavoring into our own mission. We want to create our own coin on the TRON net. We will need to have some of the best tallent working for us. The meaning of being on the TRON net is to be a VERY strong presence. The bigger and better we are the bigger and better TRON is. 
 
 Youtube - Tronstronics - We already have education videos on youtube. We will continue to make this channel with updates and further education for all of the TRON community as well as the future Troincs. We are excited to see the channel grow after we are elected and with out a dought are more than excited to recieve feedback from the Troniacs out there. What do they want to see as far as contests and how we can improve the TRON community.
