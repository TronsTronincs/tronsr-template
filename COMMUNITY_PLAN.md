This is our plan. Rewards Part I

We are VERY excited to roll out our Community Plan. This is what it will take to get more users in everyday life to use TRX. We start with REWARDING people that will help the most. Businesses!!!
Rewarding businesses for using #TRX

These are the ways that we will get businesses to use TRX
   -There will be a Reward pool for every company under TronsTronics. Example: 200000 TRX every quarter will be divided         out to each company depending on the % of TRX that has been used for purchases. The company with the highest % of           TRX used will get the highest % of TRX as a reward. This will encourage each company to have TRX used as payment over       credit card companies and cash
   - We will set up all marketing for the use of TRX in store and online for each company
   - We will give businesses full access to our IT department. 
   - This includes but not limited to Website designs, business analysis to reach more customers, custom programs to help         create more sales using TRX. 
   - Full access to a State of the art Real Estate marketing company to expand operations.
   - We will fully set up TRX as payment for the company
   - 24/7 support
   - We will reward those companies that HODL TRX after purchases. 
   - We have a reward program for repeat customers that use TRX on our businesses that are under TRONS TRONICS

Community Plan Rewards Part II
