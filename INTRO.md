A short introduction about your team

First and fore most we are a small group with HUGE expectations, we would love to be a part of the TRONSR. We ask for your VOTE!!! 
Thank you in advance!!!

As we start off to tell you about who we are. We would like to thank everyone from the TRON community (token holders), the TRON Team around the world, all of those that have supported TRON from day one, those who have heard about TRON and just joined, we would like to thank all of you on medium, slack, telegram and twitter amoung the many other Social media sites. 

We are first and formost here to make the TRON name bigger. The role of a TRUE representative should be to represent the brand. The definition of representative is : a person or group to act or speak for another or others as an example :TronsTroincs is an excellent representative for TRON to reach out and spread the word. 

It is way more than just saying a few words or sending some TRON to people that already have some. HEY I have TRON I would love more!!! This is about getting the world to know about TRON. This is investing into the actuall communities around the world. This is about making TRON a common name. Helping the youth with scholorships for college in the IT field. Donating to local high schools in the name of TRON. 

We will be creating a coin on the TRON net and we will be aking ever effort to make it one of the biggest on the net work. The bigger we are the more TRON grows. It is a win for everyone.
