The definition of representative is : a person or group to act or speak for another or others.

Hello, my name is Robert. I am head of all operations here at TronsTronics. I have 26 years of business management. I have over seen several well established operators as a regional manager. Working with P&Ls, managers, marketing teams, HR department and several other divisions. Why are we the best candidate? We are going to make TRON, NOT only a house hold name but a solid part of cryptocurrency within our communities around the world. We are already talking to business across the country to accept TRX as a payment option. We will be investing into these companies and giving them full access to our IT team, this means that they will have the best web sites. The best business analysis to make them more competitive. 

I am lookng forward to this adventure with Tron as we grow as a community. We truly look forward to expand the horizons of tron and our own token that will be listed on the TRON net, as well as within our communities all over the world.

  We will be donating TRX to, but not limited to local schools, hospitals, non profit organizations, churches, police & firefighters and other organizations that serve our communities for the better in the name of TRON. We will also be asking whom we donate to, to accept TRX.  

Our team is working on our token that will be placed on the TRON network. We will be a HUGE contributor to the TRON network.
