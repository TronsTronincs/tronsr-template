Hello, my name is Robert. I am head of all operations here at TronsTronics. I have 26 years of business management. I have over seen several well established operators as a regional manager. Working with P&Ls, managers, marketing teams, HR department and several other divisions we are the best candidate to make TRON NOT only a house hold name but a solid part of cryptocurrency. I am lookng for this adventure with Tron as we grow as a community. We truly look forward to expand the horizons of tron within our community.
